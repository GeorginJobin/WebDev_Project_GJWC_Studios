        <p class="pfont"><strong>Hola! I’m Sofia Martinez</strong>, the owner of <strong>Anime Haven</strong> - a place
            where anime, manga and webtoon fans can feel right at home!</p>

        <p class="pfont">I’ve been a passionate anime fan for as long as I can remember. Whether it’s finding the next
            big series, rewatching old favourites, discovering new releases, anime has always been a huge part of my
            life. That love is what inspired me to create Anime Haven - a shop dedicated to sharing the fun, creativity,
            and community that anime brings to all of us. And now, as Anime Haven launches online, I hope to share my
            passion with the whole world.</p>

        <p class="pfont">At Anime Haven, we believe anime is more than just entertainment - it’s a culture, an art form,
            and a way to connect with others who share the same enthusiasm. Our goal is to bring that energy online with
            a bright, welcoming space where fans can <strong>explore, discuss, and celebrate anime together</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="pfont">Whether you’re hunting for collectibles, discovering hidden gems, or joining conversations
            about your favourite shows, <strong>Anime Haven</strong> is your spot to connect and be inspired.</p>

        <p class="pfont">So, if you love anime as much as I do - welcome! I’m so excited to share this journey with you.
        </p>
